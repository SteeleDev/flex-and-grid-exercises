# Flex and Grid Exercises - Spooky Style ðŸŽƒ

## Background

These exercises reinforce the concepts of CSS flex and grid properties. You can see both the unfinished and \_complete versions so you can compare your work to mine.

The breakpoint_example shows off how you can use grid to support multiple breakpoints (mobile and desktop).

## How to Run

The files are pure HTML and CSS. That means all you need to do is download / clone the repository, navigate to the example you want to try in your file explorer, right-click and 'open with' your browser of choice. As you make changes, you'll need to refresh to see them applied.
